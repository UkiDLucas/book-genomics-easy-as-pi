## Welcome

The reason this eBook is posted on GitHub is because I do want people to contribute.

### Goals for this book

It is important to keep in mind some goals for this book:

1) Book should be easily understood for people with basic computer & science background, therefore it should be written in a plain language with points made clear.

2) This book is not meant to be a scientific research paper, so no scientific jargon, references, or proofs are necessary if they would take away from ease of understanding.

3) This book should take advantage of being online and stay up to date, you can always contribute by checking the latest statistics and updating the content.

### Review open Issues

I am writing [Issues](https://github.com/UkiDLucas/genomics-easy-as-pi-book/issues) as a means to ask for community help, if you see an issue that you know you could address then try to help by contributiing:

https://github.com/UkiDLucas/genomics-easy-as-pi-book/issues

### How much can I contribute?

If you are adding new content, then feel free to add as much as you want, but expect that you will be asked to make edits and changes to your text before merging it to the book.

If you are **changing existing text**, then very little, usually you should limit your edits to:

- updating facts (numbers)
- fixing spelling
- improving sentence clarity and structure

## How do I contribute?

### Understanding GitHub Open Source

First, I would recomment that you spend couple of hours watching few YouTube videos on the general GitHub Open Source subject, I have created a playlist specifically for Open Source:

### What is Markdown?

The syntax formatting using "Markdown" (*.md) files

Please get familiar with basics of Markdown script:

### Text Editor

You can use any text editor you like, but I would recommend WYSIWG tool like [Typora](https://www.typora.io/).

### GitHub account

Create your GItHub account, as you learn more about Open Source you will get to love it and you will want to contribute to many projects.

### Forking the project

Once you watch the GitHub Open Source videos you should be able to "Fork" the project to your own GitHub account.

### Create new branch

Create a new "Branch" that describes specific changes you are making

`genomics-easy-as-pi-book $ git branch`

`add-gitignore`

`master`

`*modify-contributing-file`

### Browser edits

You can make Mardown changes in the browser, it is the easiest way to contribute

### Cloning the fork locally

You can copy the "forked" project to your own computer

`git clone https://github.com/YOUR_ALIAS_HERE/genomics-easy-as-pi-book.git`

### Using Git

Once you get some experience with Open Souce you will be using Git command line comments all the time

Commmit (you can use GitHub desktop)

example command line commit:

`genomics-easy-as-pi-book $ git status`

`modified:   CONTRIBUTING.md`

`genomics-easy-as-pi-book $ git add CONTRIBUTING.md`

`genomics-easy-as-pi-book $ git commit -m "added majority of the new content to CONTRIBUTING.md"`

`genomics-easy-as-pi-book  $ git push`
