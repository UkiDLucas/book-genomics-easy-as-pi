## Welcome

The reason this eBook is posted on GitHub is because I do want people to contribute.

### Goals for this book

It is important to keep in mind some goals for this book:

1) Book should be easily understood for people with basic computer & science background, therefore it should be written in a plain language with points made clear.

2) This book is not meant to be a scientific research paper, so no scientific jargon, references, or proofs are necessary if they would take away from ease of understanding.

3) This book should take advantage of being online and stay up to date, you can always contribute by checking the latest statistics and updating the content.

### How much can I contribute?

If you are **changing existing text**, then very little, usually you should limit your edits to:

- updating facts (numbers)
- fixing spelling
- improving sentence clarity and structure

If you are adding content, then feel free to add as much as you want, but expect that you will be asked to make edits and changes to your text before merging it to the book.

## How do I contribute?

### Understanding GitHub Open Source

First, I would recomment to spend couple of hours watching few YouTube videos on the subject, I have created a playlist specifically for Open Source:

### What is Markdown?

The syntax formatting using "Markdown" (*.md) files

Please get familiar with basics of Markdown script:

### Text Editor

You can use any text editor you like, but I would recommend WYSIWG tool like Typora.

### Forking the project

Once you watch the Open Source videos you should be able to 

1) "Fork" the project to your ouw GitHub account

2) Create a new "Branch" that describes specific changes you are making

`genomics-easy-as-pi-book $ git branch`

`add-gitignore`

`master`

`*modify-contributing-file`



3) Make changes in the browser, or

4) Copy the project to your computer:
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_ALIAS_HERE/genomics-easy-as-pi-book.git

5) Make changes to a file

6) Commmit (you can use GitHub desktop)

example command line commit:
