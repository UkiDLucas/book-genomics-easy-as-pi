## "Genomics-easy as Pi" eBook
### DIY parallel cluster computers and blockchain in big data genetic research

This github project will serve as an experiment to see if I could get a valuable contributions from the community for the future updates to this book.

The book points out that recently there was a convergences to two, previously unreachable technologies, 1) genetic sequencing is for the first time affordable to average person 2) distributed computing has became affordable and sparked development in technologies like blockchain. 

I would love to see people contrubuting more information to the existing version and in the future create translations.
