Processing of the bioinformatics data is a very wide field, everyone will have different needs and techniques. There are hundreds of research papers published every month, in USA alone there are couple of hundred thousands of people working in related professions. China and Europe are also mega hubs for this field. Therefore, there is no way to describe them in a single book. The idea however that with the inexpensive cluster computer composed of 256 cores, 1.4 GHz processors, each supported by 1GB of RAM, access to relatively fast 64 GB of SD storage and WiFi Internet, maybe a NAS, such cluster computer can become an entry ticket for aspiring software development team, or a science researcher on a budget. Such computer should be very feasible in 2016 and twice as good each year after. 
Finally the computer is only a tool, useless when not utilized and brilliant when running a well designed software solving great ideas.
