# RPiCluster Photos Credit

The cover photos of RPiCluster has been included with permission of Dr. Josh Kiepert, whose work and YouTube videos were early inspiration for this book. Although the cluster computer portrayed, being composed of single core processors,  is not the optimal configuration for multi-threaded programming languages, it was a state of the art for the time it was built.

Dr. Josh Kiepert doctoral work was focused on in-network collaborative processing within wireless sensor networks. To facilitate his dissertation work, Josh designed and built the RPiCluster as a means of testing his wireless sensor network data sharing algorithms and for simulation of complete wireless sensor networks implementing these algorithms. Josh completed his PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Boise State University in 2014.
