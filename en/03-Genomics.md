#Genome primer 

Genome is a “big data” in its true sense. When you take two people’s DNA, you will find a difference on average every 1,500 letters. That adds up to 2, or 3 million differences between two individuals. If you try to compare thousands, or millions of individual humans, gut bacteria, soil, or ocean fauna and flora — you will end up with a lifetime hobby, a great career, or hopefully both. 
Knowing the DNA differences is just a beginning, you will have to make sense of thousands of proteins that are coded by it, how they interact with each other and influence the organisms. 
It is out of scope of this book to teach the reader genetics, or molecular biology here, but it might be worthwhile to provide a primer.
DNA
DNA (deoxyribose nucleic acid) is composed from two spiral strands — a helix image easily recognized by anyone. Each strand is composed of a sugar-phosphate structural backbone and the connecting matching bases (letters ACGT) that provide the genetic code.
When determined by presence and balance of certain proteins, the double helix of DNA can be un-zipped and using bunch of helper proteins (think of single purpose robots) DNA is translated to message RNA (mRNA) which carries protein encoding instructions to the rest of the cell.

## RNA

RNA is very similar to DNA, but it is single stranded. The big difference is that instead of having base letters “ACGT” it uses “ACGU” instead. Letter “U” substitutes letter “T”.  The cells use mRNA to carry information out to minimize the chance of DNA corruption during the time it is unzipped.
Beside mRNA, there are several other types of RNA performing various cell regulatory and structural functions.
Nucleotide base pairs
Bases in DNA are made up from 2 pairs of matching letters A-T and C-G. If you have letter C on one DNA strand, the other side will have corresponding letter G. Similarly, if you have letter A on one strand you will ALWAYS find T on the other.
Well, except when you don’t. The ancient DNA, as can be found in 40,000 old bones may have base substitutions, but that is another story.
As already mentioned in RNA T is replaced with U.
Common DNA base names:
A - adenine
C - cytosine
G - guanine
T - thymine

Common mRNA base names:
A - adenine
C - cytosine
G - guanine
U - uracil

Extended (not complete) list of base names:
m5C - 5-methyl-cytosine: modified base due to DNA degradation
Ψ - pseudouridine: modified base due to RNA degradation
D - dihydrouridine: modified base due to RNA degradation
I - inosine: modified base due to RNA degradation
m7G - 7-methylguanosine: modified base due to RNA degradation

## Codons and Amino-acids

You read genetic sequence always in precise order in one direction from 5’ to 3’ named after the chemical (atom) structures. Codons are 3 letter base sequences that code for amino-acids, or indicate a “stop” sequence of the gene. Therefore a shift of even a single letter renders a read useless. Nature (proteins) deal well with the techniques of where to start reading and where to stop.
There are 20 amino acids, that when chained together, are used to create proteins. Some of the 3 letter codons code for the same amino-acid. There are many more amino-acids available in nature both on planet Earth and in outer space, but we are concerned only with these 20 that are building blocks of life (on Earth).

List of 20 amino acids and their abbreviations
Alanine (Ala)
Cysteine (Cys)
Aspartic acid (Asp)
Glutamic acid (Glu)
Phenylalanine (Phe)
Glycine (Gly)
Histidine (His)
Isoleucine (Ile)
Lysine (Lys)
Leucine (Leu) 
Methionine (Met)
Asparagine (Asn)
Proline (Pro)
Glutamine (Gln)
Arginine (Arg)
Serine (Ser) 
Threonine (Thr)
Valine (Val)
Tryptophan (Trp)
Tyrosine (Tyr) 
STOP (not an amino-acid)

## Genes

DNA sequence of codons called a gene determines an order of amino acids, which then assemble a protein. Today we have databases of thousands of proteins, but we still do not understand what most of the genome is coding for and how these proteins function. There are about 24 thousand known genes in human genome alone, there could be many, many more across different varieties of life on the planet.
In software the large chunks of DNA sequences could be spliced along the STOP codons and analyzed as separate genes, therefore speeding up the process and adding additional parallelism (each protein producing section could be queued and processed in a new thread).
Knowing mutations in certain genes could worn us of as much as 90% of getting certain types of cancer which would open new doors for preventive medicine.
Histones
Histones are protein disks around which DNA strand wraps to create chromatin shape which we can see under the microscope. The composition of the histones can change due to environmental exposure causing segments of DNA to be turned on, or off.
Proteins
As I already mentioned there are thousands of known proteins, some of them very short lived (minutes or hours), some of them such as hormones provide triggers for other processes, others provide building structure such as cartilage.
Whereas identifying differences in multiple genomes is computer intensive process, it is really not the difficult one. Learning which proteins are being generated, what is their function and interaction, how they fold and what is their 3D structure is definitely a challenge.
The study of proteins is called proteomics and one could argue it is one of the most important of all future sciences, adequately Greek word root “prota” means “of primary importance”.
The biggest protein known, titian, is composed of 26,926 amino acids. We do not know how many naturally occurring proteins there are, but there could be millions.
In addition to performing their little functions inside the cells, proteins have unlimited other uses such as carrying oxygen in hemoglobin, providing structure of cartilage, silk, or spider web which is one of the strongest materials known today. 
Traits
All the learning about genetic differences and molecular biology of the organism is totally meaningless if we do not know the details about the organisms themselves, we will have to be able to create a comprehensive databases of traits associated with given genome (the organism). Given a large set of DNA sequences from many people we would be able to tell how closely related they are to each other, draw genealogy tree and estimate when the tree branches separated. I would be able to compare the genome against the database of known genes and tell you that certain individual may have a risk (we will talk about epigenetic soon) for certain condition. 
To learn more, we will have to describe each organism and build a new set of genome data by associating thousands of traits. To make it simple to visualize, example (and not very scientific) traits that we would like to compare to similarities and differences between various organisms:
pigmentation (eyes, skin, hair, etc)
hair type (in mammals): straight, curly, etc.
ability to secrete certain substances (e.g. mammalian milk, pheromones, etc.)
and many, many more.

## Epigenetics

Finally, knowing the genetic code is only the beginning of the journey to understand the biology of life. All cells in your body start with exactly the same genetic code. Healthy cells do not loose, or mutate the genetic code, yet in their development they can become diversified in their function and morphology. When comparing the cells of nerves to liver, using a microscope, one would never guess that they are created from the same genetic blueprint. 
In the animal world, for example, the queen bee and worker bees, coming from exactly the same genetic stock differ completely as if they were different species.
We know that genes can turn on and off for prolonged periods of time, sometimes for a lifetime, or generations, based on sex, the environmental conditions such as nutrition, exposure to pollutants such as DDT, plastics, pesticides, etc. 
All men have one X chromosome featuring about 1300 genes. Yet in most men, the genes responsible for female characteristics are turned off for life. In rare cases they are not turned off resulting in a genetical male (having Y chromosome), yet with female morphological features and hormones.
Trans-generational epigenetics
It is quite sobering, but the chemicals your grandmother was exposed to, might have caused developmental changes in your mother and the egg cells that created you and your siblings. The reproductive egg cells are created already in the embryo of the growing girl. Hunger and exposure to the toxins a hundred yeas ago (20+20+60) may result in chronic diseases in your middle and later years. 
20 years - reproductive age of your grandmother’s generation
20 years - reproductive age of your mother’s generation
60 years - epigenetic chronic diseases showing up 100 years later.
There are couple ways that epigenetic changes are written in our DNA such as: DNA methylation, protein composition changes of histones with acetyl and other chemical groups involved.
This is a new science, but there are already ways to detect methylations on particular genes, the other way of detecting epigenetic changes would be to infer them from the proteins (including hormones) our body creates.
Non-Protein Coding DNA and RNA
Science, until recently, has been focusing on about 2 percent of DNA that is coding for proteins. Proteins, especially those most critical to life, have been evolving over many millions, if not billions of years of evolution and do not change very often, in fact we share most proteins with other, “lower”, animals. Considering only the presence of protein-coding DNA we would not be able to account for differences between chimps and humans.  
The rest of the DNA, ignored until now, does not create new, smarter Homo Sapiens brain proteins, but rather controls how to use existing proteins. In fact that is the real difference between a simple worm and a human — we have almost the same amount of protein coding genes, but many more ways to manage what we already have. 
You can imagine this as having a warehouse full of electronic components (proteins) — one organism gets schematic how to put it into a Roomba cleaning robot, other creates a cluster computer.
Discovery of the function of remaining 98% of the genome will be definitely a challenge and a real eye-opener.
Preventive medicine
Once we get to know our genes, we learn about their mutations and the epigenetic influences, we will be, for the first time, able to prevent diseases before their onset. We will know that we have increased chance of having particular cancer, Alzheimer’s disease, obesity,  diabetes, or certain heart failures, before we actually develop them. Our doctors and dietitians will be for the first time able to prescribe us specific foods and micronutrients to take, or to avoid, based on our own individual needs. They will suggest lifestyle changes that we need and they will be able to give us drugs that are tailored to our own bodies. The generic drugs, good-for-all diets and generic lifestyle suggestions will be the thing of the past in the later 21 century.
